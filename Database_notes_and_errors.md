Error Checking the Diet Database
================================

# General
 Early papers do not have standardized habitat descriptions
 Unidentified yes/no is not consistent
 Verifying prey names stops midway through database


# Beal 1898
 Data from yellow-billed and black-billed cuckoos
 Number of sites in paper seems to be unclear, not necessarily 999
 

# Beal 1900
 Some data is entered about Brewer's blackbird early in database, but more relevant data has been added so initial data maybe should be   deleted


# Beal 1912
 Habitat descriptions need to be standardized
 Of the data listed from this study, only the following sets of data from these species add up to 1:
 Ash-throated flycatcher, diet by items
 Cassin's kingbird, diet by items
 Say's phoebe, diet by items
 Scissor-tailed flycatcher, diet by items
 Great crested flycatcher, diet unspecified
 
 
# Beal 1918
 Fraction diet by occurrence adds up to 2


# Beal 1941
 Number of sites in paper seems to be unclear, not necessarily 999


# Bent 1942
 Habitat descriptions need to be standardized

# Carlisle 2012
 Data includes frequency by item for family when available; not all frequencies for each bird species add up to 1 in original data
